1.start docker
2.navigate to the root directory of your cloned project(where the docker file is)
3. run docker build -t your-image-name .
4. run docker images to confirm that the image was successfully built
5. run Docker run â€“p 8081:8080 [docker image name] to spin up the container
6. Test the endpoints: refer to the postman collection in the project repo

N.B: I intentionally didnt add security to the application to make testing seamless
and also because it was not part of the original requirement
I can add security if instructed to do so subsequently
